# Authentication Fix Guide

## Changes Made to Fix Authentication Issues

### 1. Updated Auth Callback Page

The auth callback page has been updated to:
- Handle URL hash parameters containing access and refresh tokens
- Add a timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Improve error handling and logging

### 2. Updated Supabase Client Configuration

The Supabase client configuration has been updated to:
- Enable auto refresh token
- Persist session
- Detect session in URL
- Use implicit flow type

### 3. Added Environment Variables

Added the following environment variables to `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

### 4. Added Middleware

Added a middleware file to handle session refreshing and token management using the recommended `@supabase/ssr` package.

### 5. Updated Google Sign-In Function

Updated the Google sign-in function to:
- Include additional query parameters for better OAuth flow
- Add error handling

## How to Test the Fix

1. Run `npm install` to install the new dependencies
2. Restart your development server with `npm run dev`
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies for localhost:3000
4. Try signing in with Google again

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that your Supabase project has the correct redirect URLs configured:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration
   - Ensure the following URLs are added to the redirect list:
     ```
     http://localhost:3000
     http://localhost:3000/notes
     http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
     ```
3. Try using an incognito/private window
4. Check if your Google OAuth credentials are properly configured

## Note on Package Updates

We've updated from the deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package to the recommended `@supabase/ssr` package for better compatibility with Next.js and Supabase's latest authentication flow.
