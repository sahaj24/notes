# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the scrolling performance of the web application. Users have reported that the site does not feel smooth while scrolling, which negatively impacts the user experience. The goal is to identify and address the factors causing poor scrolling performance to provide a smooth, responsive user interface that meets modern web performance standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth scrolling throughout the site, so that I can navigate content without experiencing visual stuttering or lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls on any page THEN the site SHALL maintain a consistent 60fps (or higher) scrolling performance.
2. WHEN a user scrolls rapidly THEN the site SHALL NOT exhibit visual jank or stuttering.
3. WHEN a user scrolls on pages with dynamic content THEN the site SHALL maintain smooth scrolling without freezing.
4. WHEN a user scrolls on mobile devices THEN the site SHALL provide the same smooth experience as on desktop devices.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks in the application, so that I can systematically address scrolling issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the application THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected to identify specific causes of scrolling issues.
2. WHEN performance bottlenecks are identified THEN they SHALL be documented with their impact on scrolling performance.
3. WHEN performance issues are found THEN they SHALL be prioritized based on their impact on scrolling smoothness.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize rendering performance, so that DOM updates don't block smooth scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render during scrolling THEN they SHALL NOT cause layout thrashing or excessive repaints.
2. WHEN images and media load THEN they SHALL NOT cause the page to jump or stutter during scrolling.
3. WHEN animations are running THEN they SHALL use GPU-accelerated properties to maintain smooth scrolling.
4. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN non-essential operations SHALL be deferred until scrolling stops.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize JavaScript execution, so that main thread blocking doesn't interfere with scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript runs during scrolling THEN it SHALL NOT block the main thread for more than 50ms.
2. WHEN event handlers are triggered during scrolling THEN they SHALL be optimized to minimize execution time.
3. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN heavy computations SHALL be offloaded to Web Workers where possible.
4. WHEN third-party scripts execute THEN they SHALL NOT negatively impact scrolling performance.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper resource loading strategies, so that assets don't interfere with scrolling performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN critical resources SHALL be prioritized to establish smooth scrolling early.
2. WHEN scrolling down the page THEN images and other media SHALL be lazy-loaded appropriately.
3. WHEN new content is loaded during scrolling THEN it SHALL be loaded asynchronously without causing jank.
4. WHEN resources are fetched THEN they SHALL be optimized in size to minimize loading impact on scrolling.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent scrolling performance across different browsers and devices, so that I have a good experience regardless of how I access the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN scrolling SHALL be equally smooth across all browsers.
2. WHEN a user accesses the site on low-end devices THEN scrolling SHALL degrade gracefully while maintaining usability.
3. WHEN a user accesses the site on high-DPI displays THEN scrolling SHALL remain smooth without performance penalties.
