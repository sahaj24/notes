# Production Deployment Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Pre-build validation and environment setup
  - Verify all environment variables are properly configured in `.env.local`
  - Check that all PayPal production credentials are correctly set
  - Validate Supabase production database connection
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Execute production build process
  - Run `npm run build` to create optimized production build
  - Verify TypeScript compilation completes without errors
  - Confirm all assets are properly optimized and minified
  - Check that build artifacts are generated in `.next` directory
  - Validate build size and optimization metrics
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Production environment configuration verification
  - Verify production PayPal client ID is loaded correctly
  - Confirm all three hosted button IDs are properly configured
  - Test production Supabase connection and authentication
  - Validate API endpoints are pointing to production services
  - Check that development-only features are disabled
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Start production server and initial validation
  - Execute `npm start` to launch the production server
  - Verify server starts without errors and listens on correct port
  - Confirm all routes are accessible and rendering properly
  - Test that static assets are served with proper optimization
  - Validate server-side rendering is working correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 5.2, 1.5_

- [x] 5. PayPal production integration testing

  - Test coin deduction and balance updates
  - Validate note saving and retrieval functionality
  - Test multi-page note generation with various page counts
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Performance and monitoring validation
  - Measure page load times and optimize if necessary
  - Verify asset compression and caching is working
  - Test application performance under normal load
  - Validate error logging is functioning properly
  - Confirm all production optimizations are active
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Security and final production readiness check
  - Verify no sensitive information is exposed in client-side code
