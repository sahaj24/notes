# Production Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for building and deploying the PayPal-integrated note-taking webapp to production mode. The webapp includes a complete PayPal payment system with hosted buttons for three pricing tiers ($4.99, $19.99, $59.99) and multi-page note generation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Production Build Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build the webapp for production, so that it can be deployed with optimized performance and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile all TypeScript files without errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL optimize all assets (CSS, JS, images) for production
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a production-ready build in the `.next` directory
4. IF there are any build errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and halt the build process
5. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL be ready for production deployment

### Requirement 2: Production Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the webapp to run in production mode, so that it uses production configurations and optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts in production mode THEN the system SHALL use production environment variables
2. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use the production PayPal client ID and hosted button IDs
3. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL disable development-only features (hot reload, debug logs)
4. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL use optimized builds with minified code
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 3: PayPal Production Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to make real payments through PayPal, so that I can purchase coins and generate notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the $4.99 button THEN the system SHALL display the production hosted button `D65N4BSG3Z5SN`
2. WHEN a user clicks the $19.99 button THEN the system SHALL display the production hosted button `7J863KLHPCGS8`
3. WHEN a user clicks the $59.99 button THEN the system SHALL display the production hosted button `9JZDUR4NLRZJY`
4. WHEN a payment is completed THEN the system SHALL credit the appropriate coins to the user's account
5. WHEN payment processing fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Database and API Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work reliably with the production database, so that my data is safely stored and retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL connect to the production Supabase database
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use production authentication tokens
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use production API endpoints
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL maintain secure connections to all external services

### Requirement 5: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want the webapp to load quickly and perform well, so that I have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL serve optimized, compressed assets
2. WHEN pages are accessed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js production optimizations
3. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL have minimal bundle sizes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for monitoring purposes
5. WHEN the app is deployed THEN the system SHALL be ready for production traffic

### Requirement 6: Security and Environment Variables

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the production app to be secure, so that user data and API keys are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL use secure environment variables from `.env.local`
2. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL not expose them in client-side code
3. WHEN the app serves content THEN the system SHALL use appropriate security headers
4. WHEN users interact with PayPal THEN the system SHALL use secure, production PayPal configurations
5. WHEN the app handles sensitive data THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices
